Pomodoro Technique, this is a project to learn Golang for me. The project is inspired by 'Focus To-Do' application that I am using. 

![tomato-clock](./doc/images/tomato-clock.gif)

The feature set is based on [antonmedv/countdown](https://github.com/antonmedv/countdown) and inspired by the [mum4k/termdash](https://github.com/mum4k/termdash) project.

tomato-clock is a simple terminal based app.I only successfully test it on macOS platform. It maybe has bug on windows platform.
