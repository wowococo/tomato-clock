# tomato-clock üçÖ
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system that encourages people to work *with* the time they have‚Äîrather than against it. Using this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks. These intervals are referred to as pomodoros. After about four pomodoros, you take a longer break of about 15 to 20 minutes.

This is a project to learn Golang for me. The project is inspired by 'Focus To-Do' application that I am using.

Use the following command to start a 5 seconds tomato clock to do the task named "learngo", and set break time 2 seconds after the tomato clock, which is just to make Gif easier. 

```
tomato-clock -d 5s -bt 2s -t learngo
```

The feature set is based on [antonmedv/countdown](https://github.com/antonmedv/countdown) and inspired by the [mum4k/termdash](https://github.com/mum4k/termdash) project.

tomato-clock is a simple terminal based app.I only successfully test it on macOS platform. It maybe has bug on windows platform.
